# One Project to Rule Them All

This repo is an exploration of combining all of my projects into a single repo.

## Ideal outcomes

- CI/CD with GitHub pushes
- Shared component library + style system
- Shared FE & BE types
- Strong linting (EsLint)
- Strong testing (Jest + Cypress)
- Performant
- Monitoring (DD)
- Tracking + Analytics (StatsD)
- Hosting costs that don't rise (much) with additional projects

## Stack

- React - I know it best, it's popular, and I can iterate on it quickly
- Emotion - I know it. I prefer CSS in JS
- Framer Motion

- Node + Express - One language for whole project
- Authentication
- PSQL - Prefer relational DB
- TypeORM
- GraphQL
  
- Postgres
- Redis - Probably overkill, but I'd like to get the XP

- Jest
- Cypress

- Datadog
- Sentry or LogRocket

- Something for emails???
- Twilio for SMS
